Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

with filter:
let array = [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53];
let unique = array.filter((item, index) => array.indexOf(item) === index);

without filter
const originalArray = [7, 9, 12, 7, 53, 'hi', 'hi']
console.log([...new Set(originalArray)])
