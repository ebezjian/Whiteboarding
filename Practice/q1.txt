Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"
Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

NOTE - thoughts

search the string for which positions the "" are in and then replace them with %20
could use split() to at least remove the spaces

recursive needs three things: base case, termination case and recursion itself.

termination case: 
if (isNan(noSpace)){
  return;
}else{
  (str.search(" ") then remove and add in %20 at those positions)
}

const string ="Jasmine Ann Jones" 
const replaced = string.split(' ').join('20%');
