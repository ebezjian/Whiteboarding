Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness
Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

Example
Input: "hello"

Output: false

Input: "copyright"

Output: true

thought process: 
1) needs to be a boolean so maybe map could work?
since we can't convert the string to an array does that remove the useage of split?
2) includes?
